Welcome to GoldenUI's documentation!
====================================

**GoldenUI** is a light-weight GUI library for pyglet.

The reason why this library is called GoldenUI is that we use the `Golden UI
<https://opengameart.org/content/golden-ui-bigger-than-ever-edition>`_ pixel art on OpenGameArt.

It is because it's based on pyglet that GoldenUI has a lot of features, such as loading images in
different formats and supporting multiple platforms.

If it is your first time hearing about pyglet and GoldenUI, we suggest you read `pyglet
documentation <https://pyglet.readthedocs.io>`_ first.
