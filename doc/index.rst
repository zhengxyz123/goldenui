Welcome to GoldenUI's documentation!
====================================

**GoldenUI** is a light-weight GUI library for pyglet.

The reason why this library is called GoldenUI is that we use the
`Golden UI <https://opengameart.org/content/golden-ui-bigger-than-ever-edition>`_ pixel
art on OpenGameArt.

It is because it's based on pyglet that GoldenUI has a lot of features, such as loading
images in different formats and supporting multiple platforms.

If it is your first time hearing about pyglet and GoldenUI, we suggest you read
`pyglet documentation <https://pyglet.readthedocs.io>`_ first.
